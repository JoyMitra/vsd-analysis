issues-sp25/final-project-ahmad_ayush/issue_2_Login & Logout System with Limited Access for Non-Authenticated Users.txt-In a web application, user authentication is crucial for managing access to certain features and functionalities. For applications with content contributions such as questions and answers, it is essential to differentiate between authenticated and non-authenticated users. Non-authenticated users should have limited access, being able to view the content but not contribute until they log in. This approach ensures both security and user accountability. The feature allows users to log in through a standard username/password method or via third-party authentication methods such as Google OAuth and GitHub OAuth. Additionally, it provides the functionality to log out and manage account creation.

issues-sp25/final-project-sarthak-nathanael/issue_8_Threat(Repudiation)_ Definition of Done for Mitigating Insufficient Logging on User Actions.txt-If we don’t accurately track user interactions with UI elements such as vote button clicks, it may be more difficult for us to track malicious actions. If we don’t properly log everything, a user could perform unauthorized actions, and we wouldn’t be able to show proof that it was a given user. Logging is important for accountability. For example, if we see a user spamming votes or comments in the logs, we may ban the user from the site, and we will have evidence of their actions. This threat is a repudiation threat because, without sufficient logging, we aren’t able to hold users accountable for their actions.

This logging will support writing down events along with identifiers for users including the IP of origin, user id (if authenticated) and timestamps which can be further analyzed to rate limit and temporarily ban certain users (logged in or not) from participating. When users perform sensitive operations like voting on content, editing posts, or flagging inappropriate content, if these actions aren't properly recorded with user identifiers, timestamps, IP addresses, and contextual information it will lead to users not taking responsibility for malicious activities for eg. users could perform harmful actions (like downvoting competitors or inserting malicious content) and later deny responsibility.

issues-sp25/final-project-yash_soni/issue_11_Definition of Done for strong password policy and securing web credentials (spoofing).txt:**Description:** To mitigate the risk of spoofing attacks, we need to address vulnerabilities in our authentication mechanisms that allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users. Spoofing occurs when an attacker falsifies or steals data to gain unauthorized access. This could be due to insecure storage of credentials, reliance on weak or single-factor authentication, or poor session management. Attackers could leverage these weaknesses to execute dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, or targeted guessing attacks based on personal information. In the context of a Stack Overflow clone, this could lead to account takeovers resulting in reputation manipulation, spread of misinformation through trusted accounts, or access to private messages and personal information.

issues-sp25/final-project-yash_soni/issue_2_Voting on posts.txt-
issues-sp25/final-project-yash_soni/issue_2_Voting on posts.txt-Context: Voting on a post increases the post's credibility. A post with many votes is considered a “better” post than ones without as many votes. When viewing a site like SO where a user may come to find “good” or correct answers to their questions, voting provides insight to the user on which posts to discard immediately. Voting can also help users evaluate their posts in retrospective, receiving less votes (or even negative votes) acts as a nudge/punishment to the OP that their post wasn’t up to the mark of the general community they posted to which can help them improve their posting behavior in the future.

issues-sp25/final-project-yash_soni/issue_3_Commenting on posts.txt-
issues-sp25/final-project-yash_soni/issue_3_Commenting on posts.txt-Context: Commenting on a post (question or answer) provides users with a space to evolve the conversation about the post without posting an explicit answer. A comment can help both the poster and a viewer. Every insight provided on a post cannot be an answer as an insight can be meta, as in about the post itself rather than an answer to the post. A comment also helps a viewer gather more context about the post, more than what the OP provided initially. A comment isn’t an answer, rather a suggestion or improvement about the post itself or used to ask for more information from the OP.

It establishes a user's session and identity within the application. The login process represents the balance between security and usability—it must be secure enough to protect user accounts while remaining simple enough not to discourage legitimate use. In platforms like Stack Overflow, login is particularly important as it enables personalized content delivery, tracks reputation and contributions, and helps maintain quality through accountability. Proper authentication also protects sensitive user data and prevents unauthorized access to private information or administrative functions.

It ensures that user sessions are properly terminated. In the context of knowledge-sharing platforms like Stack Overflow, proper logout functionality prevents session hijacking that could lead to impersonation, unauthorized posts, or access to private messages.
