issues-sp25/final-project-yash_soni/issue_2_Voting on posts.txt-Context: Voting on a post increases the post's credibility. A post with many votes is considered a “better” post than ones without as many votes. When viewing a site like SO where a user may come to find “good” or correct answers to their questions, voting provides insight to the user on which posts to discard immediately. Voting can also help users evaluate their posts in retrospective, receiving less votes (or even negative votes) acts as a nudge/punishment to the OP that their post wasn’t up to the mark of the general community they posted to which can help them improve their posting behavior in the future.
